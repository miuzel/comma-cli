# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working on this repository. Assumes no prior knowledge of the project.

## Project overview

**comma-cli** (binary name: `comma`, installed as `,`) is a tiny, stateless CLI that translates natural-language intent into a single shell command using an LLM, then optionally executes it after user confirmation. It is a command *generator*, not an agent: one intent → one command → execute → done.

- Language: Rust (edition 2021), single crate, single binary.
- Current version: `0.17.0` (see `Cargo.toml`; the binary reports `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`).
- Repository: https://github.com/miuzel/comma-cli
- License: MIT.
- Platforms: Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, aarch64), Windows (x86_64). On Unix the binary is installed as `,`; on Windows as `comma.exe` (PowerShell reserves `,`).

## Repository layout

The application is a single binary crate split into modules under `src/` (no `lib.rs`). Major areas inside each module are marked with `// ── ... ──` banner comments.

- `src/main.rs` — entry point and dispatch: CLI parsing (only *leading* args are flags; `--` ends flag parsing), `--version`/`--update`/`-h`/`--test`/`-v`/`-vv`, one-shot mode (args joined as intent, trailing `!` = auto-confirm) vs interactive REPL mode, piped stdin → one-shot with line-based confirmation, execute/edit/refine loop.
- `src/ui.rs` — terminal UI: rustyline `FileHelper` (filename Tab-completion), candidate selector (`|||` separated alternatives), spinner, print helpers (`print_info`/`print_error`/`print_debug`/`print_cmd`), confirm/edit/refine prompts (crossterm raw mode, `atty` checks, line-based fallbacks for piped stdin), char-boundary-safe `truncate`, clipboard copy.
- `src/config.rs` — config loading: legacy single-model format and multi-provider `providers`/`models` format, `COMMA_*` env overrides, API-style auto-detection, `home_dir`.
- `src/context.rs` — system context gathering (distro, kernel, arch, shell, CWD, user-installed packages) and privacy placeholders (`{{USER}}`, `{{HOSTNAME}}`, `{{HOME}}`) — collected locally, substituted into LLM output only after the response.
- `src/prompt.rs` — system prompt loading (`~/.local/bin/,.prompt.md` with `DEFAULT_PROMPT` fallback compiled in), `prefer` tool-preference formatting.
- `src/llm.rs` — LLM clients: OpenAI-compatible (`/v1/chat/completions`) and Anthropic (`/v1/messages`, optional `reasoning` thinking budget), blocking `reqwest` with rustls; ordered fallback and per-model retries in `call_llm_with_retry`.
- `src/cache.rs` — response cache (`~/.local/bin/,.cache.json`, oldest-entry eviction, atomic save only when dirty; entries cached only after the user executes the command; `cache_size: 0` disables caching entirely).
- `src/update.rs` — self-update (`--update`) from GitHub releases, with archive verification against the release's `sha256sums.txt` and cross-device/locked-exe handling.
- `src/protocol.rs` — `#CHECK:` (tool availability probe) and `#EXPLORE:` (run a help command once and learn from output) protocol handling, chained in `process_response`.
- `src/danger.rs` — danger detection: `DANGER_PATTERNS` substring list (whitespace-normalized) plus exact-token pipe-to-shell matching (`curl x | sh` flags, `| shuf` does not), red ⚠ warning.
- `src/tests.rs` — `run_tests`, the built-in self-test suite (see Testing below).
- `Cargo.toml` — dependencies: `reqwest` (blocking, json, rustls-tls), `serde`, `serde_json`, `sha2` (update checksums), `atty`, `crossterm`, `rustyline`. Release profile: `strip = true`, `opt-level = "z"`, `lto = true` (size-optimized ~3MB binary — keep it that way).
- `config.json` — default config template (shipped and copied to `~/.local/bin/,.config.json` on install).
- `prompt.md` — default system prompt template (shipped and copied to `~/.local/bin/,.prompt.md`). Placeholders: `{{SYSTEM_CONTEXT}}`, `{{PREFERENCES}}`.
- `build.sh` — builds with cargo and installs to `~/.local/bin` (see below).
- `install.sh` — end-user installer: downloads the latest GitHub release archive for the detected platform and verifies it against `sha256sums.txt` when available.
- `uninstall.sh` — removes `,`, `,.config.json`, `,.prompt.md` from `~/.local/bin`.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — release pipeline (see Deployment).
- `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` — user documentation (English / Chinese). Keep both in sync when changing user-visible behavior.

## Build and test commands

```bash
cargo build            # debug build
cargo build --release  # release build (binary: target/release/comma)
./build.sh             # release build + install to ~/.local/bin/, (also copies
                       # config.json → ~/.local/bin/,.config.json and
                       # prompt.md → ~/.local/bin/,.prompt.md if missing)
```

There is no `cargo test` suite and no CI check workflow — do not assume one exists.

## Testing instructions

Testing is done via a built-in self-test flag compiled into the binary:

```bash
cargo run -- --test          # or: ./target/release/comma --test
```

`run_tests()` in `src/tests.rs` runs 56 ad-hoc assertions (placeholder substitution, privacy leak checks on gathered context, empty-HOME guard, `#CHECK:`/`#EXPLORE:` parsing, candidate parsing, char-boundary-safe `truncate`, `is_dangerous` pattern and pipe-to-shell matching, retry constants) and exits non-zero on failure. When you change parsing or privacy-related logic, add matching checks to `run_tests()` and make sure `--test` passes. Manual smoke test (requires a configured API key): `, list files larger than 1G`.

## Code style guidelines

- Keep the module structure; new code goes in the module it belongs to (see Repository layout). Split a new module only when a change genuinely demands it.
- Match the existing style: `// ── Section ──` banner comments separating major areas, short doc comments on non-obvious functions, plain `String`/`Result<_, String>` error handling (no `anyhow`/`thiserror`).
- Blocking, synchronous code throughout (reqwest blocking client); no async runtime — do not add tokio.
- Keep the dependency list minimal and the binary small; check `Cargo.toml` before assuming any crate is available.
- Terminal output goes through the existing helpers (`print_info`, `print_error`, `print_debug`, `print_cmd`) with crossterm colors; interactive input uses crossterm raw mode, with `atty` checks and line-based fallbacks for piped stdin.
- Comments and documentation are written in English (user docs also have a Chinese translation, `README.zh-CN.md`).

## Configuration and runtime data

- Config resolution priority: `COMMA_*` env vars (`COMMA_BASE_URL`, `COMMA_API_KEY`, `COMMA_MODEL`, `COMMA_API_STYLE`) → `~/.local/bin/,.config.json` → `~/.claude/settings.json` env section (legacy path only) → built-in defaults. API style is auto-detected from URL (`anthropic` in URL → Anthropic Messages API, otherwise OpenAI-compatible).
- The multi-provider `providers` + `models` format in the config enables ordered fallback with per-model `retries`. In this format `COMMA_MODEL` overrides only the primary (first) entry's model.
- `cache_size` sets the response-cache capacity; `cache_size: 0` disables the cache entirely (nothing read back or written).
- `reasoning` (Anthropic only) sets the thinking budget in tokens; `max_tokens` is raised accordingly so values ≥ 1024 work.
- Runtime files all live beside the binary in `~/.local/bin/`: `,.config.json`, `,.prompt.md`, `,.cache.json`.

## Security considerations

- **Privacy by design**: username, hostname, and home path must never be sent to the LLM API. The system context sanitizes CWD to `{{HOME}}`/`{{USER}}`, and the model is instructed to emit `{{USER}}`/`{{HOSTNAME}}`/`{{HOME}}` placeholders that are substituted locally after the response. On interactive refine, the *raw* (pre-substitution) reply is what goes back to the API as conversation history, so real paths never leak. Preserve this invariant — `run_tests` has explicit "context does not leak ..." checks.
- Config files contain API keys (`auth_token`); never commit real keys, log them, or print them in verbose/debug output.
- Generated commands are shown for confirmation before execution; dangerous patterns are flagged via `DANGER_PATTERNS` and pipe-to-shell matching. Piped stdin is no exception: `echo intent | ,` asks for a `y` line on stdin before executing, and only `echo intent | , !` (auto-confirm) skips it. The `!` auto-confirm flag and `--update` self-replacement exist by design — be careful not to weaken the confirmation flow silently.
- `#EXPLORE:` commands requested by the model are executed via `sh -c` after user confirmation (a single probe asks too) unless auto-confirm; output is truncated to 4096 chars before being fed back to the LLM.
- Self-update (`--update`) verifies the downloaded archive against the release's `sha256sums.txt` before replacing the binary.

## Deployment process

Releases are fully automated via `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. Push a git tag matching `v*` (after bumping `version` in `Cargo.toml`).
2. GitHub Actions builds release binaries for 5 targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` (via `cross`), `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
3. Each is packaged (`comma-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz`, or `.zip` for Windows); a `sha256sums.txt` covering all archives is generated and published to the GitHub release by `softprops/action-gh-release`, together with `install.sh`.

End users install/update via `install.sh` or the built-in `, --update`, both of which pull from GitHub releases and verify the archive against `sha256sums.txt` — so archive names in the workflow, `install.sh`, and `do_update()` in `src/update.rs` must stay consistent.
